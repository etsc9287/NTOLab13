 * SO if a band were to conver 50% of your ticket then you will only pay the other 50%. However if they say they will cover $50 of your ticket. Has inflation rises, they will cover less and less of your ticket. This seems to be the same trend with goverment funding to colleges and income. The percent of college funding ( based on average persons income) is going down while the income is increasing. This seems like they are spending a fixed amount even though thier average income is increasing.
 
 * The correlation between income and gov spending on college is negative and its significant occording to the permutation correlation test. The coor is -.53.
